The purpose of lab assignment 2 is to utilize the libraries and methods learned from assignment 1 and apply them to least square estimation problems. This includes creating functions and utilizing linear algebra functions inside of python libraries to create a weighted least squares estimation and applying it to data inside of an excel file. The next problem requires us to analyze pseudorange and satellite positioning data using a non linear least squares approach.
