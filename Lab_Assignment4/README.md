Concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns are quite omnipresent in the construction of Civil Structures owing to their great axial capacity and having advantages of both building materials i.e. concrete and steel negating each otherâ€™s downside. Nowadays Concrete-filled stainless-steel tubular (CFSST) columns are being preferred over the traditional concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns given their superior corrosion resistance While extensive experimental and numerical research has been conducted to assess the behavior of CFSST columns under various loading conditions, accurately predicting their axial capacity remains challenging. The distinct properties of stainless steel compared to carbon steel render the existing design code equations for conventional CFST columns unreliable for predicting the strength of the CFSST columns. To address this issue, the Machine Learning (ML) approach has been used. In Structural Engineering the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained some popularity in academia nowadays to circumvent the limitations of the existing design philosophies.
The main aim of this study is to leverage the ML techniques, to overcome the limitations of traditional prediction methods and provide a more reliable solution to estimating the axial capacity of CFSST columns. To achieve this, a comprehensive dataset comprising 422 circular and rectangular CFSST columns has been meticulously compiled from the existing literature about the experimental studies done in the past. This extensive dataset serves as the foundation for developing robust ML models capable of accurately forecasting CFSST column performance.
