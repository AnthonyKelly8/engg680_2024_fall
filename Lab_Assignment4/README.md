The purpose of lab assignment 4 a support vector machine classifier model will be made using inertial sensor data. From this we will then train a similar model using specified features instead of the entire dataset to compare the models performance. By comparing the results of the first two models a third iteration will be done on a final set of data comprised of what the team will believe to be the optimal parameters. The optimal parameter models performance will then be tested and compared against a classification algorithm. This assignment will allow us to demonstrate our overall knowledge of python, and our ability to choose and optimize parameters to properly train a machine learning model.
